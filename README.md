# `puzzle`

project puzzle is an attempt to make self-contained wasm applications and runners, interchangable with one-another, making it possible to develop an app/game once and run it anywhere puzzle has a runner

to make this possible, puzzle uses many modules to communicate between the app and the runner, all of which can be found in [`glue`](/glue)
